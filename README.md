# Route Kernel

**Route** is the kernel of the Roading project, a personal operating system I'm building entirely on my own. It is written in Rust and serves as the core of the system.

## Project Overview

Roading will be composed of several components:

- **Route**: the kernel. 
- **Excavator**: the bootloader. 
- **Asphalt**: the init system.
- **RCS (Rock Command System)**: the command system. 
- **Rockutils**: essential utilities. 
- **Rsh (Rock SHell)**: the shell. 
- **Paving**: the text editor.
- **Cementation**: the desktop environment. 

Each component can be used independently or modified to fit your needs.

## Usage

You can use Route Kernel as the base of your own OS. Feel free to modify it or integrate it with your projects. But remember that the kernel was made by me: Matheus Ribeiro.
